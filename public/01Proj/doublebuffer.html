            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Computers typically operate in sequential way by breaking large tasks into smaller ones. In this way, computers will perform one task at a time, one after another. Modern computers are so fast that the human eye cannot perceive each step,
                namely in image processing. </p>
            <p>However, in the world of video games, the computer must render graphics in real time, and update each image every frame. Since computers perform one task at a time, running video games in this way runs into a problem. Graphics are constantly
                being rendered while the game runs. The intention of this design pattern is to display every pixel at the same time, instead of one pixel at a time.</p>

            <h2>How Does Double Buffering Work?</h2>
            <p>Video games use 2 framebuffers, instead of 1. The first framebuffer shows the player the current image, meanwhile, the next image is written to the second buffer. By instantly swapping buffers, the player sees a seamless transition to the
                next frame. It is a constant cycle of showing the player one buffer, writing to the next buffer, swapping buffers, writing to then next buffer, and repeat.</p>

            <h2>When to Use It</h2>
            <p>It is appropriate to use this method when all of these criteria are true:</p>
            <ul id="criteria">
                <li>We have some state that is being modified incrementally.</li>
                <li>That same state may be accessed in the middle of modification.</li>
                <li>We want to prevent the code that’s accessing the state from seeing the work in progress.</li>
                <li>We want to be able to read the state and we don’t want to have to wait while it’s being written.</li>
