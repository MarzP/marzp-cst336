                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Computers typically operate in sequential way by breaking large tasks into smaller ones. 
                In this way, computers will perform one task at a time, one after another. 
                Modern computers are so fast that the human eye cannot perceive each step, namely in image processing. </p> 
                <p>However, in the world of video games, the computer must render graphics in real time, and update each image every frame.
                Since computers perform one task at a time, running video games in this way runs into a problem. 
                Graphics are constantly being rendered while the game runs.
                The intention of this design pattern is to display every pixel at the same time, instead of one pixel at a time.</p>

                <h2>The Key Idea</h2>
                <p>Design Patterns are tried and true methods of making our lives easier as Software Engineers. Since there is a pattern among making monsters (Ghosts, Demons, and Sorcerers are all <em> Monsters </em> )and making spawners for each monster
                    (Ghost Spawner, Demon Spawner, and Sorcerer Spawner are all <em>Spawners</em>, then <strong>the Prototype Pattern demands that we make something that repeats this pattern for us.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <br /><br />
            
            <div id="bufferKeyIdea">
                <h2>Implementation</h2>
                <p>To implement this, we give our base class, Monster, an abstract <em> <strong>clone() method: </em> </strong>
                </p>
                <img src="img/04clonemethod.JPG" />
                <p>Every class that derives from the base class would then proceed to create an implementation returns a new object identical in class and state to itself.</p>
                <img src="img/05monsterclone.JPG" />
                <p>Once all our monsters support that, we no longer need a spawner class for each monster class. Instead, we define a single one:</p>
